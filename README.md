# X-ray Mapping

This code was implemented in X-ray Mapping of Nanoparticle Superlattice Thin Films

The Python script batch processes TIF files of SAXS data to (1) find the center, (2) integrate around the scattering ring, (3) find the maximum peak in polar coordinates, (4) bin the angle, (5) and make a heat map.
